# nwitter

# Overview
The solution consists of 2 parts:
- Backend: This is a wrapper for Twitter REST APIs deployed on heroku. The reason for this is keeping Twitter API ID & secret key away from client side.
- Nwitter: iOS Application connects to backend & performs the job.

# Running
Open terminal & navigate to "Nwitter" directory & run "pod install" then open the XCode workspace in XCode
